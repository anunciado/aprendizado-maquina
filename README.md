Information technology study about machine learning using the libray scikit-learn for the Python programming language and their related concepts. 

First, we need to know that machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed, this is a denifition described by Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence and the coined the term "Machine Learning" in 1959 while at IBM. 
Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
So, int machine learning there are two types of algorithms to solve problems of data analytics: the supervised Learning and the unsupervised learning.

## Supervised Learning 

In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.
Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems. In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function.
In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.
Examples of supervised learning are: Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, etc.

###### Linear Regression

###### Logistic Regression

###### Decision Tree

###### SVM

###### Naive Bayes

###### KNN

###### K-Means

###### Random Forest

###### Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm

###### Gradient Boost and Adaboost

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. 
We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables. We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.
Examples of Unsupervised Learning are: Apriori Algorithms and averages approximation.
